# feedback-sys

Most of the pages on OI Wiki are contributed by volunteers, and the quality varies. We currently have no way of knowing the quality of each page and the voice of users. This project plans to write a user feedback system to help users quickly provide feedback on the problems encountered when reading pages. Collect user evaluations of pages. Facilitate targeted improvement of page quality.

You will need:

- Use Git/GitHub and other tools for collaborative development.
- Use email/IM and other tools to communicate with community members.
- Familiar with HTML, JS, CSS, and common front-end frameworks such as Vue, React.
- Familiar with backend, serverless, and other technologies.
- Passionate about algorithms and data structures.
